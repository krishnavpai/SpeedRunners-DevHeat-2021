                <p style="font-size:18px;">Spending time in nature will help to make you less stressed and depressed. In a world overcome with worries and distractions, taking the time to get outside can help relieve some of those daily stresses. Getting into the great outdoors has a calming effect on our minds even if it's just for a little bit each day.

                The least amount of time you should spend outside is five hours each month. The wilder the nature, the better. Research says that spending at least five hours in nature a month helps with your health and wellbeing.

        <h3 class="title">Eat a healthy, balanced diet.</h3>
        <div class="flex-container">
            
            <div>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you balance the energy you consume with the energy you use. If you eat or more than your body needs, the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight.

                You should also eat a wide range of foods to make sure you're getting a balanced diet and your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs.It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).

        <h3 class="title">Sleep 7-9 hours every night.</h3>
        <div class="flex-container">

            <div>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">The quality of your sleep at night directly affects your mental and physical health and how well you feel during the day. Sleep impacts your productivity, emotional balance, etc. No other activity delivers so many benefits with so little effort!

                When you’re scrambling to meet the demands of a busy schedule, though, or just finding it hard to sleep at night, getting by on less hours may seem like a good solution. But even minimal sleep loss can take a substantial toll on your mood And energy. And over the long-term, it can wreak havoc on your mental and physical health. By addressing any sleep problems your energy, efficiency, and overall health will go up.

        <h3 class="title">Be more active during the day.</h3>
        <div class="flex-container">
            
            <div>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">If you’re like most American adults, you spend most of your waking hours at work and struggle to fit everything else (like exercise) into your “free time”. And who are we kidding, sometimes by the end of the work day there’s little time or energy left for getting active.
                
                What if you could work out while you work, without having to carve out a big chunk of time? You can – by taking all those little opportunities to move more throughout your day.Create a routine of stretches and exercises you can do without getting up from your chair.

        <h3 class="title">Get 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week</h3>
        <div class="flex-container">

            <div>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">Moderate aerobic exercise includes activities such as brisk walking, biking, swimming and mowing the lawn. Vigorous aerobic exercise includes activities such as running, heavy yard work, etc. Strength training can include use of weight machines, your own body weight, heavy bags, resistance tubing or resistance paddles in the water, or activities such as rock climbing.

                If you have been inactive, you may need to start slowly. You can keep adding more gradually. The more you can do, the better. But try not to feel overwhelmed, and do what you can. Getting some physical activity is always better than getting none.

            <div>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">Although the brain gets plenty of exercise every day, certain activities may help boost brain function and connectivity. This in turn may help protect the brain from age-related degeneration. The brain is always active, even during sleep. However, certain activities can engage the brain in new ways, potentially leading to improvements in memory, cognitive function, or creativity.

                Older adults, pregnant women, and people who have special health needs should check with their health care provider on how much physical activity they should get and what types of activities they should do.

            <div>
                <p style="font-size:18px;">You may have heard of the saying to “drink 8 glasses of water a day”, yet not many may actually follow this, often choosing to count their total liquid intake instead – which usually includes sodas, coffee, and other beverages.
 
                Your body isn’t made up of soft drinks and beers, however. Depending on age, about 60% of the human body is made up of water. There are numerous benefits of drinking more water – it helps us to control our calorie intake, energises our muscles, keeps our kidneys healthy, and hydrates the skin.
